# open_learning_assistant

An Open Source Software that helps you learn complex topic easily with the power of Language models.

## Motivation

Learning complex topics and internalising them is hard, common challenges faced by students are:

- Pre-requisite clarification
- Doubt Clarification
- A system that never gives them the answer write away but probe the students by asking counter questions so that students can come up with the solution based on hint.
- A test taking system, that will test the deep understanding for the topic
- A revision framework that helps to create mental models
